 Age detection is the process of automatically discerning the age of a person solely from a photo of their face. Typically, you’ll see age detection implemented as a two-stage process: 

Stage #1: Detect faces in the input image/video stream 

Stage #2: Extract the face Region of Interest (ROI), and apply the age detector algorithm to predict the age of the person 

Age plays a significant role in interpersonal interactions among people who live in communities. The use of smart gadgets has expanded as technology has progressed, and social media has begun to draw everyone's attention. Daily studies on age prediction have grown in prominence, it increases the number of apps that use such techniques. In these applications, facial photographs are commonly employed since they contain useful information that may be used to extract human interaction. 

 

 

 

 For age prediction, Image processing, feature extraction, and classification steps are usually used. These steps may change based on the objective of the study and the characteristics to be used. The face images were processed using a variety of approaches, and calculations were performed based on the results of the investigations. For image processing, there are two basic and typical which we need to follow. Image enhancement is the process of improving an image so that the resultant image is of higher quality and can be used by other applications. The most popular technique for extracting information from an image is the other technique. The image is divided into a specified number of parts or objects in order to solve the challenge and this procedure is called Segmentation. 

 

 

 Due to the accuracy of its classification technique, deep learning techniques are a variety of tasks such as classification, feature extraction, object recognition, and so on, it helps in age prediction. the previous system’s machine learning algorithms were not utilized to improve classification skills for a vast number of images and data available via the internet. In this paper, Deep Learning techniques are used to reliably estimate a person's age from a single facial capture. We might use age categories based on the experiment to forecast a person's age. The eyes are one of the most essential aspects of face images in various applications such as facial recognition and emotional expression. Human Facial Image Processing gives numerous hints and signs that can be applied to a variety of businesses, security, entertainment, and others.  

 

The expression on a person's face can reveal a lot of information about them, such as their emotional condition, the slightest agreement or disagreement, irony or fury, and so on. Faces have become an important subject of study in psychology for this reason. Gender detection can provide a wealth of information to firms' recruitment teams, for example. Verification of ID cards, such as voter ID cards, which are used by millions of people to vote in elections, and so on. Finding ineligible or fraudulent individuals is made easier with human facial image analysis.
